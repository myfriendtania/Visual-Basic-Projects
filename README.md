# Visual Basic Projects 



######

This repository is made to store all the assignments from my Intro to VB.NET class.
These assignments were all created by Professor/s Jack Hagan / Mary Mulligan at El Centro Community College for SPRING 2020.

These are just what I completed.These are not solutions for you to copy and use. They are my own.
You can use them as food for thought. Please respect that.

I may add my own projects into this repository in the near future but as of now, it is for VB.NET assignments. DO NOT copy.
